## Smart Verification Strategy

### Stage 1: /verify (Initial Bulk Verification)
**User action:** Enter video IDs → Click "Verify"

**Backend does:**
1. Batch query BigQuery for all video IDs (1 query)
2. Get intro/outro/logo paths from BigQuery
3. Batch check ALL paths exist (intro, outro, all videos)
4. Calculate total duration
5. Build initial sequence
6. Return to frontend with:
   - All items with path_available status
   - Total duration
   - Default logo

**Frontend does:**
- Open Sequence Builder
- Show total duration
- Allow editing

### Stage 2: Sequence Builder (Individual Item Verification)
**User actions:**
- Add manual video path → Verify immediately
- Add transition path → Verify immediately
- Upload image → Save immediately
- Reorder items → No verification needed
- Remove items → No verification needed
- Change logo → Verify immediately

**Backend endpoints:**
- `POST /verify-single-path` - Verify one path (returns duration + exists)
- `POST /verify-video-id` - Verify one video ID (returns path + title + duration)
- `POST /uploads/image` - Upload image (already exists)

**Response:**
{
  "path_available": true/false,
  "duration": 120.5,
  "resolution": "1920x1080",
  "is_4k": false
}

---

### Stage 3: /submit (No Verification Needed)
**User action:** Click "Submit"

**Backend does:**
1. Take the sequence as-is (all already verified)
2. Create job record
3. Queue Celery task
4. Start processing immediately

**No path verification!** Everything already checked.

## Benefits:
✅ Faster initial verification (batch operations)
✅ Real-time feedback when adding items
✅ No final verification needed
✅ Better UX (immediate feedback per item)
✅ No waiting when submitting

## Question:
Should we remove the `/verify-paths` endpoint entirely since we verify as we go?
Or keep it as a "final check" option?
